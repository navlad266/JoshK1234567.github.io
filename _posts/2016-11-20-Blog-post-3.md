**Starting point-**Near the end of stage 2

**Target-Finish-**To complete the stage 2 assessment

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson review:**

**How did i learn? What strategies were effective?**

Today my partner and I were working on the assessment of stage 2 and found it quite hard but stuck at it and we felt that perseverance just like we have done in many weeks has really helped us to get far in our work and achieve more and helps us work quicker.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

There were no bad things that we did but our computer was zoomed in very far and our mouse had very high sensitivity so we did not know how to change that which annoyed us quite a bit.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

We may have to look more deeper into the fuze setting to help us in the future so we don't have anything like that happening today because it slowed us down quite a bit but if we try to get familiar with the settings then we will prevent this from happening.
