**Starting point-**A blog that wouldn't get a high mark

**Target-**To learn what I needed for a higher mark

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective? **

In today's lesson what went well was thinking about how I needed to change my blog and what wasnâ€™t good about my blog and how I could get a better mark. I realised that I need to is look further into my GitHub code and think about my markup code more too. I realised looking at my blog that I need to use more complex tools and make my blog better than it currently is.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I think I needed to make more notes and more detailed notes about what I could improve on my blog and about how I could improve my blog and how I could make it better as I could have written a lot meet to help myself and make my job easier when I was improving my blog at home.

**What will I change for next time? How will Improve my learning?**

I should try to make more notes in lessons on what I need to work so this way I can try to make my life easier as I won't have to work things out at home and I get can get the most out of my lessons.
