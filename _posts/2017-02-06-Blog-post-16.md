**Starting point-**16% through the python exercises

**Target-**To get 19% through the exercises

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective? **

Even though you may think I should have set a higher goal at the beginning of the lesson I read through the 1st exercise I realized I should not set as high a goal and I just about reached my target but I think I reached my target because I took notes from previous exercises and applied those skills to future learning which I think helped me get through the exercises.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I need to improve on how focused I a on my work as if I am not fully focused then I will not be able to get through as much work as possible but when I am focused I can work really well and this has been a target of mine for a while and I need to apply it to my learning.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I need to try not to get distracted by friends and peers so I can focus more and get more work done.
