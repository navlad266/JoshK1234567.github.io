**Starting point-**Beginning of Stage 3

**Target-Finish-**Get through most of Stage 3

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Well, today's lesson was very good as me and my partner found a great system for working as effectively as possible. I don't know how we didnâ€™t find this out before but my partner or I would read it out and the other person would write and we worked so quickly.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

Well, we did not get our equipment quick enough which meant we ran out of monitors making us have not as much working time. We still did reach our target but could have exceeded it.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

We will have to get set up quicker and get equipment quicker to be able to get more work done so we know we will be able to reach our target. Or we may be able to get very far ahead with our new system.
