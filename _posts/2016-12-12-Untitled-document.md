**Starting point- ** Trying to get feedback on my blog

**Target-**  To get feedback on my blog

**Did I reach my target?- **yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

I think today I really listened to what my partner said to me as feedback and tried to really reflect on it.I saw what he said was true and considered ways to fix my work. The things he suggested I improve are the legibility of my titles, the sentences in my work and many there are, make more of my content about what I did in the lesson and vary what my targets are as they are sometimes they are the same.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I think what I could work on is self initiative as some of these problems were easily fixable and they really should not have been my targets as they would have been easy to do if I had thought more in depth about what I could have done to improve my blog.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

In anything I do I should use my brain to improve things as my targets were silly and things I should have really already fixed.
