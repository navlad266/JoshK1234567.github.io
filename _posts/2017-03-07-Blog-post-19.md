    <td>I managed to achieve my target of 26% from 23%. Today I was really struggling with some of the exercises on codecademy however, I feel quite a lot about of it was really having the concentration to persevere and keep going and try different things and trying not to give up and maybe just ask a friend as when I tried my hardest I think I did well and I really did a good job in terms of how hard I worked and how I kept my focus.

    <td>I did not do this all the time though. There is something on codecademy where you can get hints to help with exercises and I think sometimes I used these too quickly before trying my very hardest on the exercises.

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>

  <tr>
    <td>So in the future I should try to not use that hint as quickly and try and work as hard on the question as possible.
