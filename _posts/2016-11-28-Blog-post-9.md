**Starting point- **middle of stage 5

**Target-Finish-**  continue with stage 5

**Did I reach my target?- **yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

What  went well was that me and my partner got through a lot of work as when we were working we worked very well together and we tried so hard it really paid off. The work may not have been the best but in previous weeks we have definitely struggled with timing and not getting sufficient work done in the lesson but this seems to have changed after making a lot of progress today.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

Even though we got through a lot of work for some reason we still got distracted through other groups and ourselves talking about other things that were not related to what we were doing in the lesson so we could have made so much progress and maybe even have got onto the robot arm but we did not unfortunately.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Well next time I will have to try my best not to get distracted from the topic and have to work my very hardest to get as much work done as possible.
