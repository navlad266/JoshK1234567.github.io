**Starting point-**Middle of stage 1

**Target-Finish-**Finish stage 1 and 2

**Did I reach my target?-**yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective? **

A strategy that were effective were reading through the booklet a few times to understand key words and phrases because this way I could process what I was being asked to do and it really helped get through some of the tougher parts of stage 1. I will definitely apply this to my learning in the future.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I don't think me and my partner worked quick enough. This limited my learning because if I worked quicker I could have finished stage 2 but I didn’t reach my target because me and my partner didn’t work efficiently enough.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

I will have to try and get set up quicker and read through the book quicker as these things will allow me to work quicker and get more work done in the time given.
