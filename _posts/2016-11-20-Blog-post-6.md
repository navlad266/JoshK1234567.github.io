**Starting point**-Stage 4

**Target-Finish**-stage 4

**Did I reach my target?**-Yes

**Lesson review:**

**How did i learn? What strategies were effective?**

Some strategies that were helpful were trying lots of different approaches to working as a pair and finding the best ones. First one person would work by themselves but it's easier  for one person to read it out and the other to write the code down.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

Me and my partner argued over who was going to type as neither of us wanted to type as we were both to lazy which really did not help us get on with work.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time we will just have to take turns  when typing and not argue about who types as this way we will be able to get a lot more done in the lesson and will prevent us from getting told off.
