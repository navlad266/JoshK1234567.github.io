**Starting point-**Not always working individually

**Target-Finish-**Think about mentality towards learning

**Did I reach my target?-**yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective? **

I think what went well for me was listening to what Mr Keen said and understanding why he was right and that me doing work for people or them doing it for me won't help us learn and that we have to work harder for the answers instead of just giving up and this way I will be able to learn a lot more because that would make sure I am making progress but if I don’t do the work I will make no progress and that won’t help me.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I think I should work on not giving up and having a better attitude towards learning as today when we continued with python by not giving up I learnt a lot more and made more progress because otherwise by not learning I will make more progress allowing me to become better at the learning task.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

The way I can apply this piece of learning is by trying to avoid my friends asking for me to do work for them and maybe just give them a hint and not ask others or help.
