**Starting point- **middle of stage 5

**Target-Finish-**  continue with stage 5

**Did I reach my target?- Yes**

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Today's lesson went very well as we really got through a lot of work but what went really well was how we understood what we were doing. This is great as we could the customise our code and make some really cool thing and I am very proud that we could do this.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

Me and my partner struggled to save our work as we couldn't get our memory sticks to appear in the computer so we may have to start some code again.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Me and my partner will have to look at how to save our work for next time as we have to save our work as we progress through the book.
