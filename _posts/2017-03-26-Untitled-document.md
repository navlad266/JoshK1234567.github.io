**Title-Codecademy Diary**                                              ** Date-26/3/17**

**Target-**To Keep a daily blog about my codecademy work.

Day 1 (The lesson)

Today I achieved my target of 35% and I think it went well as I was working on a new topic but I managed to get to grips with it well and after a while I managed to get a lot of work done. However it was hard as I could not understand some of the language as I was looking at a new topic however I could improve this by reading the instruction in detail to help me understand more about the topic and get even more work done.

Day 2

I definitely found things easier coming back to the ocde as I had only just done it a day before and I remembered things better as it was fresh within my memory and I think I also got more work done in 15 minutes than i have before on codecademy when I have not done it the day before so I think that if I continue this pattern I will make more progress on codecademy.

Day 3

I m very happy with this method of 10 minutes a day as I think I am making a lot more progress as the work is always fresh in my mind and it is easier to come back to and work becomes more easier however in only do about 10-15 minutes of work a day so maybe I could do some more however Mr Keen said it was enough and as long as I am making progress that is what matters.

Day 4

Today after doing codecademy I further realized why this method is so effective and Now I know the benefit that i will gain if I continue to do this method I and I really fell by doing this it will really help me. I think I am making great progress and today I did 20 minutes of work as this was a target that would also help me.

Day 5 

Now I really believe this method does not have a knock on effect as all the days I have been working on codecademy I think that I remember everything that I have done and I can work quickly and efficiently. I think if I keep this process going then soon I will move on to make a battleship.
