    <td>In today's lesson what went well was thinking about how I needed to change my blog and what wasnâ€™t good about my blog and how I could get a better mark. I realised that I need to is look further into my GitHub code and think about my markup code more too. I realised looking at my blog that I need to use more complex tools and make my blog better than it currently is.</td>
