**Starting point-**A poor blog

**Target-Finish-** Know how to make a fully customized blog

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

I think this lesson was really good as it taught me that I should really take care with my blog and customize and this is also why I have changed my layout of my blogs and I have a new background which goes better with the colour of the writing.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I need to try to use my initiative as when we were customizeing our blog I felt a bit stupid as I could have just done these simple things earlier on when creating my blog and it would have looked great but I didn't and it really did not look very neat and professional but at least I have changed it now.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

This has taught me to use my initiative more often and make things the best I can instead of cutting corners like I was and make sure everything I do is to the best of my ability.
