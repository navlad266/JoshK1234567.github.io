**Starting point-**Beginning of stage 2

**Target-Finish-**To get through most of stage 2

**Did I reach my target?-**yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

This week my partner and I worked much quicker and exceeded our target nearly finishing stage 2. I had to use this strategy because last week I did not reach my target stating I had to work quicker. So after doing this I am glad it worked out  how i needed it too otherwise we would never make any progress.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

What limited our learning was sometimes we got distracted talking to each other about things that were not related to the work or talking to other pairs about random things. This limited my learning because it distracted me and slowed me down which I have to avoid.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Next time I will need to not get distracted by friends and focus on mine and my partners work so we can work quicker and won't risk getting told off by the teacher.
