    <td>In today's lesson, we did a bit more work on encryption, we were using the vlookup tool. What helped me to learn was utilising good listening skills and applying what Mr Tansley told us to my work. I think by carefully listening I was able to learn more and take more in and remember it for when I did my own work. I think this worked as I was successful and I was able to use the Vlookup tool.

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>However what did not help was the fact that sometimes if I was stuck I would ask one of my friends for help on parts I forgot or did not understand. Even though I listened and understood most of it I could have been more independent.

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to work out things that I am stuck on by myself even if it takes a while and try to become more independent. I will not ask my friends for help and I will work out everything for myself. This way I will also learn more and I will not just be copying.
