**Starting point-**A blog with the incorrect coding

**Target-Finish-**To have a fully working blog

**Did I reach my target?-**Yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

When Mr Keen said because I was using red carpet for markdown I would have to create a new blog I was rather annoyed and really wanted to get my blog working again. One method that worked well was perseverance. Even when things were not going so well I had to chose new approaches and strategies and it did work in the end as I did end up with a fully working blog.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I think something limiting my learning today was not checking that the coding was incorrect as this put me in the situation of having to make a new blog so once I did that I was appy but if I checked my blog more often I could have easily avoided this.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Well I have learnt to keep checking my blog regularly and making sure nothing goes wrong so I don't have to make a new blog and this could save me plenty of time in the long term and prevent me from having to ask Mr Keen or Mr Ampah-Korsah as they may be angry I messed up my blog again.
