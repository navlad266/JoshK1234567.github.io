**Starting point-**9% through the python exercises

**Target-**To get 15% through

**Did I reach my target?-**yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective? **

I think at the beginning I was rushing through the exercises and not properly reading through everything which was not the best approach however when I read through everything it made a lot more sense and this allowed me to get a lot more exercises done and I got to 19% in the exercises so it worked and the method was very effective.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

I need to make sure I do not jump straight into exercises and that I actually read through them and take them a bit slower and work bit by bit because when I go in to quickly I might think I know what I am doing but actually I have to read the instructions to find out and also I should not underestimate myself as I chose 15% as a target but I got 16% so maybe I should set a higher goal.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

So, to conclude I feel that to better my learning I should read carefully through the instructions for each exercises and not rush in without reading them because I will understand what I am doing more from this.
