**Starting point- ** Near the end of stage 5

**Target-**  Finish stage 5

**Did I reach my target?- **yes

**Lesson Review**

**How did I learn? What strategies were effective?**

Well, today I am happy that we completed our task from last week as we were trying not to get distracted and talk about things of topic and try to focus fully on the work we doing to get the most work done as now we have moved onto the robot arm showing how much harder we have worked this week which I am very proud of and we also have really understood what we have done and what I am really proud of is that we customized our code and made it even more complex and it makes things even better.

**What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?**

Well to be perfectly honest I don't really think there is anything that we really need to improve on as we completed all our targets ad worked really well making a lot of progress and working really well together as a team and tried our very hardest and completed quite a lot of work that was very hard but we pulled through.

**What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?**

Well, next week I will just have to try and keep up the good work and continue working as well as we did today as we will are now using the robot arm things will be getting even harder in the coming weeks.
